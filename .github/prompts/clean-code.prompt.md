# Clean Code Prompt

You are an expert coder and your task is to clean up this code, simplify it, and make it more elegant while retaining all functionality.

## Objective

Refactor the provided code to be cleaner, more maintainable, and aligned with Quail's coding standards.
Make sure to look through every file given to you and apply the same principles across all of them.

## Clean Code Priorities

1. **Simplify complexity** - Remove unnecessary code and simplify complex logic
2. **Improve readability** - Use descriptive names and clear patterns
3. **Follow TypeScript best practices** - Proper typing and type safety
4. **Maintain component focus** - Each component should do one thing well
5. **Preserve functionality** - All original features must work as before

## Specific Improvements

- Convert any class components to functional components with hooks
- Replace prop drilling with appropriate context or state management
- Extract repeated logic into custom hooks
- Break large components into smaller, focused ones
- Use proper TypeScript types instead of `any`
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Remove redundant comments while keeping necessary documentation
- Optimize imports and remove unused dependencies
- Follow React best practices for effect dependencies

## Follow-up

After implementing changes, explain the key improvements you made and any patterns you applied that should be used elsewhere in the codebase.
